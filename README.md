## Blockstrap (The OpenSource HTML5 Blockchain Framework)

The Blockstrap framework provides a front-end HTML5 interface for web-applications to communicate and manipulate blockchains using either external web-accessible APIs or self-hosted local QTs direct from the source.

By default, it is configured to use the [BlockCypher API](http://blocksypher.com) but as well as being a blockchain-agnoistic framework, Blockstrap is also API-neutral throughout. This allows you to host and manage your own API end-points or select from others configured at core, with examples included and ready for use with the following services:

* [BlockCypher](http://blockcypher.com) (Supporting 3 Chains)
* [BlockTrail](http://blockcypher.com) (Supporting 2 Chains)
* [LocalQTs](#) (Supporting 2 Chains)

The framework itself is currently capable of supporting the following blockchains:

* [Bitcoin](#)
* [DashPay](#)
* [Dogecoin](#)
* [Litecoin](#)
* [Bitcoin Testnet](#)
* [Litecoin Testnet](#)
* [DashPay Testnet](#)
* [Dogecoin Testnet](#)

The framework has been developed with modularity and flexibility as the focal point of each technical decision. 

Currently providing a choice of interchangable modules - features can be easily extended, included, replaced or removed depending on the need of each application from a choice of the following [modules](modules/) that available upon download:
